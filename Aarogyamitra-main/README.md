## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (LTS version)
- **MongoDB** (locally or use MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based database)

- **OpenAI API key** for GEMINI functionality

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthmate.git
cd healthmate
```

2. **Install dependencies for the backend**:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. **Install dependencies for the frontend**:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

4. **Set up environment variables**:

Create a `.env` file in both the **backend** and **frontend** folders and add the following:

**Backend:**
```env
PORT=8000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

**Frontend:**
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://aarogyamitra.onrender.com
```

5. **Run the project locally**:

- Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
node ./server
```

- Start the frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend
